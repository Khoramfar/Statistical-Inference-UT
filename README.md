# Statistical Inference Course Homeworks and Project - University of Tehran (Fall 1402)

This repository contains homework assignments and the final project for the **Statistical Inference** course at the University of Tehran. The assignments and project involve the application of statistical methods such as probability theory, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, bootstrapping, and regression analysis to real-world data.

## Homeworks Overview

### Homework 1:
- **Topics:** Probability theory, random variables, birthday problem, Bayesian analysis, Monte Carlo methods.
- **Key Problems:**
  - Alarm system reliability.
  - Analyzing the birthday problem using probability and simulation.
  - Bayesian analysis of a taxi identification scenario.
  - Monte Carlo simulation to estimate Ï€.

### Homework 2:
- **Topics:** Confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, randomized surveys, sample size determination.
- **Key Problems:**
  - Application of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for dice probabilities.
  - Statistical estimation and variance calculation for sensitive surveys.
  - Simulating sampling distributions for health data.

### Homework 3:
- **Topics:** Bootstrapping, ANOVA, p-value correction, regression analysis.
- **Key Problems:**
  - Constructing confidence intervals using bootstrapping on diabetes data.
  - Comparing battery lifetimes using ANOVA.
  - Regression analysis between height and weight in a dataset.

## Final Project Overview
The final project involves working with a dataset to apply several statistical methods:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing and summarizing categorical and numerical variables.
- **Parametric Inference and Estimation:** Estimating parameters and constructing confidence intervals.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating and testing hypotheses, including ANOVA.
- **Regression Analysis:** Exploring relationships between variables using regression techniques.
